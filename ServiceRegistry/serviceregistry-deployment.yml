#Here are the steps to dockerize a microservices application using Kubernetes where you have a common module for shared POJO/DTO classes:
#
#
#  1. Create a Dockerfile for each microservice. This will build an image for that service.
#  2. For the common module, create a Dockerfile to build an image that just packages the JAR with the common classes.
#  3. Build Docker images for each of the microservices and the common module.
#  4. Push these images to a registry like Docker Hub so they are accessible to Kubernetes.
#  5. For deploying on Kubernetes, create Deployment and Service manifests for each microservice.
#  6. For the common module, create a Kubernetes ConfigMap containing the JAR file.
#  7. In the Deployments for other microservices, add a volume mount that maps this ConfigMap.
#  8. The JAR from the common module will be available to other microservices via this volume mount.
#  9. Deploy all the manifests to Kubernetes using kubectl.
#  10. The microservices will run with the shared common classes mapped via ConfigMap volume.
#
#
#This allows you to leverage Kubernetes ConfigMaps to share common code across microservices in a decentralized way. Let me know if you need any examples or have additional questions!
